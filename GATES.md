# Gates: ReleaseBond MVP on MST Testnet

OWNS: contracts/**, web/**, demo/**, scripts/**, README.md, HANDOFF.md, GATES.md, .gitignore, package.json

Scope: a working ReleaseBond web app (GitHub-issues-style findings, threaded adversarial review, evidence engine) backed by a tested ReleaseBond escrow/commitment/settlement contract deployable to MST Testnet, pushed to GitHub with a handoff note.

- [ ] G0: this ledger states outcomes that can fail
  CHECK: node /home/adithyan/.claude/skills/unlazy/scripts/gate-lint.mjs GATES.md
  EXPECT: LINT OK
  EVIDENCE: pending

- [ ] G1: the contract test suite passes, covering escrow, commit/reveal, settlement caps, refunds and access control
  CHECK: node scripts/check-contracts.mjs
  EXPECT: CONTRACT SUITE VERIFIED
  EVIDENCE: pending

- [ ] G2: the compiled bytecode is accepted by the live MST Testnet EVM (chain id and deploy gas estimate measured over RPC)
  CHECK: node scripts/check-mst-testnet.mjs
  EXPECT: MST TESTNET DEPLOY ESTIMATE OK
  EVIDENCE: pending

- [ ] G3: web unit tests pass (commitment hash parity with Solidity, evidence rules detect the malicious fixture and stay silent on the benign control)
  CHECK: node scripts/check-web-unit.mjs
  EXPECT: WEB UNIT VERIFIED
  EVIDENCE: pending

- [ ] G4: the web app typechecks and produces a production build
  CHECK: node scripts/check-web-build.mjs
  EXPECT: WEB BUILD VERIFIED
  EVIDENCE: pending

- [ ] G5: a full lifecycle runs end to end against a local chain through the real HTTP API (fund, commit, reveal, review thread, reproduction, adjudication, on-chain settlement, withdrawal balances)
  CHECK: node scripts/check-e2e.mjs
  EXPECT: E2E LIFECYCLE PASSED
  EVIDENCE: pending

- [ ] G6: the Docker sandbox records install-time telemetry (sensitive file read and outbound connection attempt) for the demo package
  CHECK: node scripts/check-sandbox.mjs
  EXPECT: SANDBOX TELEMETRY VERIFIED
  EVIDENCE: pending

- [ ] G7: the pacman adapter downloads a real Arch package, verifies its hash and normalizes it into a ReleaseArtifact
  CHECK: node scripts/check-pacman.mjs
  EXPECT: PACMAN ADAPTER VERIFIED
  EVIDENCE: pending

- [ ] G8: history has several granular commits, none carrying a Claude co-author trailer, and origin/main equals local HEAD with a clean tree and handoff docs present
  CHECK: node scripts/check-repo.mjs
  EXPECT: REPO STATE VERIFIED
  EVIDENCE: pending

- [ ] G9: the ReleaseBond contract is deployed on MST Testnet from the owner's Bridgekey wallet and the app is configured with its address
  EVIDENCE: pending
